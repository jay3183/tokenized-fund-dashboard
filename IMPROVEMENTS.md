# GraphQL Intraday Yield - Code Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the GraphQL Intraday Yield codebase.

## Schema Improvements

1. **Consolidated Schema Definition**
   - Eliminated duplicate schema definitions by removing `schema.js` and using only `schema.graphql`
   - Enhanced schema with proper documentation comments
   - Added descriptive comments for all types, queries, and mutations

2. **Consistent Naming Conventions**
   - Changed fields like `totalAUM` to `totalAum` for consistency
   - Renamed `units` to `shares` for clarity across the codebase
   - Changed `amountUSD` to `amountUsd` throughout

3. **Input Type Definitions**
   - Added proper input types for mutations (e.g., `MintSharesInput`, `RedeemSharesInput`)
   - Improved type safety with non-nullable fields where appropriate

## Code Structure Improvements

1. **Resolver Enhancements**
   - Improved error handling in mutations
   - Aligned resolver field names with schema field names
   - Enhanced clarity in object property access
   - Consistent return types across all resolvers

2. **Server Logic Improvements**
   - Consolidated data simulation into a single function
   - Improved time-dependent yield calculation with more realistic market patterns
   - Enhanced NAV simulation with mean reversion behavior
   - Better logging for server activities

3. **Mock Data Improvements**
   - Consistent naming in mock data objects
   - Realistic audit log entries with proper timestamps
   - Added `inceptionDate` to fund data for completeness

## Documentation and Testing

1. **README Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive README with:
     - Installation instructions
     - API overview with example queries
     - Project structure explanation
     - License information

2. **Test Script**
   - Added `test-queries.js` for easy API testing
   - Included examples of all main queries and mutations
   - Simple execution with `npm run test-queries`

3. **Package.json Updates**
   - Added proper project metadata
   - Updated dependencies to specific versions
   - Added test and dev scripts

## Overall Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Single source of truth for schema
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Better code organization

2. **Enhanced Developer Experience**
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Easier testing with example queries
   - Clear project structure

3. **Better Performance**
   - More efficient data simulation
   - Reduced code duplication
   - More realistic market simulations

4. **Future Development**
   - Codebase is now better structured for:
     - Adding TypeScript support
     - Implementing production data sources
     - Adding authentication
     - Building client applications
